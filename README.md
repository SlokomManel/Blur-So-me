## Towards User-Oriented Privacy for Recommender System Data: A Personalization-based Approach to Gender Obfuscation for User Profiles

This repository releases the Python implementation of "PerBlur" in our paper "*Towards User-Oriented Privacy for Recommender System Data: A Personalization-based Approach to Gender Obfuscation for User Profiles*": [paper](http://google.com).
PerBlur stands for Personalized Blurring. 
PerBlur is an amelioration of:
  * *BlurM(or)e* (published in RMSE@RecSys'2019 Workshop): [paper](https://pure.tudelft.nl/portal/files/68758824/short2.pdf), [code](https://github.com/STrucks/BlurMore),
  * *BlurMe* (published in RecSys'2012): [paper](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/ioannidis/static/pdf/2012/blurme.pdf).
  
 
Figure below shows the overall process of gender obfuscation and the evaluation that is carried out to assess whether our goals are met
