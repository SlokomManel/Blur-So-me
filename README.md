# Blur-So-me
## Bringing Gender Obfuscation in the User-Item Matrix to Top-N Recommendation

This repository releases the Python implementation of "Blur(So)me" in our paper "Blur(So)me: Bringing Gender Obfuscation in the User-Item Matrix to Top-N Recommendation".

Blu(So)me is an extension of BlurM(or)e (published in RMSE@RecSys'2019 Workshop) and BlurMe (published in RecSys'2012)
Figure below shows the overall process of gender obfuscation and the evaluation that is carried out to assess whether our goals are met are depicted in Figure below.
