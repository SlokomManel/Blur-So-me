# Blur-So-me
## Bringing Gender Obfuscation in the User-Item Matrix to Top-N Recommendation

This repository releases the Python implementation of "Blur(So)me" in our paper "*Blur(So)me: Bringing Gender Obfuscation in the User-Item Matrix to Top-N Recommendation*" [link to Blur(So)me!](http://google.com).

Blu(So)me is an extension of:
  * *BlurM(or)e* (published in RMSE@RecSys'2019 Workshop): [link to BlurM(or)e!](https://pure.tudelft.nl/portal/files/68758824/short2.pdf), [link to BlurM(or)e's Github!](https://github.com/STrucks/BlurMore),
  * *BlurMe* (published in RecSys'2012) [link to BlurMe paper!](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/ioannidis/static/pdf/2012/blurme.pdf).
  
Figure below shows the overall process of gender obfuscation and the evaluation that is carried out to assess whether our goals are met.
